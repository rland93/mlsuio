My name is Mike Sutherland. I am getting my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering at the University of California, Irvine. I created this website to show off all the cool stuff I am working on. Before coming to UCI (and switching careers!), I co-owned and operated [a legal consultancy](http://ajlmedia.com) serving clients in the San Diego region. I am interested in autonomous systems, control, and machine learning, and the programming of those systems. I also like to read & write, surf (locals only!) and play [board/video] games for fun.

I love the internet, but sometimes its app-ification grates. So I made this static HTML website to keep the spririt of the place alive. I use [hugo](http://gohugo.io) to manage content on the site.
