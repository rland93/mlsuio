My name is Mike Sutherland. I got a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from the University of California, Irvine, in 2022. I created this website to show off all the cool stuff I am working on. Before attending UCI (and switching careers!), I co-owned and operated [a legal consultancy](http://ajlmedia.com) serving clients in the San Diego region. I like programming a lot, and have a particular passion for modeling complex things in computers. I also like to read & write, surf (locals only!) and play [board/video] games for fun.

I am actively looking for a junior software engineering role.

I love the internet, but sometimes its app-ification grates. So I made this static HTML website to keep the spririt of the place alive. I use [hugo](http://gohugo.io) to manage content on the site.
