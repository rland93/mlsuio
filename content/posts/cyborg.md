So, I am officially a cyborg. Well, I have actually been a cyborg since about 2006 or so. But today, my subsystems were upgraded to a new model.

# Type 1 Diabetes
I have Type 1 Diabetes. Type 1 is an autoimmune condition where the body's immune system destroys its own islet cells, which are responsible for the production of Insulin. Insulin is a critical hormone which regulates the body's ability to metabolize glucose -- which is its main source of energy. 

Insulin is like a key to a door in the cell. This door allows glucose (a.k.a, sugar) to pass from the bloodstream into the cell, where it can then be broken down to make energy for the cell's function. Without insulin, the glucose gets broken down in the stomach, released into the bloodstream, and... it just sits there, because the key to the cell (insulin!) is missing. 

So, you can eat anything you want as a diabetic, but if you have no insulin, you will starve to death. You not only starve -- your body, in its quest for energy, breaks fat down directly, which causes the release of fatty acids directly into the bloodstream. Without insulin, this process causes an acute medical emergency called ketoacidosis. Your blood turns into acid. I like this, because it gets me a little bit closer to becoming the Alien from Alien; I don't like it, because it's excruciating and can lead to death within a couple days.

People used to just die from ketoacidosis. But, thanks to [two wonderful gents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin#Discovery) (and the ongoing efforts of some smart biochemists and scientists) we now can synthesize insulin, which can then be dosed to prevent this. Some people still can't get insulin -- you may have read [news stories](https://archive.ph/BvJn6) about people who are "rationing" insulin. When you hear the term "rationing insulin," what you should imagine is people's blood turning into acid. Then, you should imagine your blood turning to acid, and think about if that would be a fair punishment for not being able to afford something that is marked up to \$30 / mL, from a production cost of [\$.20 - $.50 per mL](https://gh.bmj.com/content/3/5/e000850). Uh, anyway.

## A Patient with Type 1 as a Dynamical System

To control my diabetes, I take a short-acting [insulin lispro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_lispro), also called Humalog.
