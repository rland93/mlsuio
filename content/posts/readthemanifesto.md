Whenever some individual does a horrible act of violence (stochastic terrorism and mass shootings &dagger;), there's always a huge amount of discussion and speculation:

* why is this happening?
* what were they thinking?
* why did they do it?
* how did things get to be like this to where this is happening to us?

You will hear pundits endlessly spout reasons for why this has happened. Often, those reasons vary wildly, depending on the ideology of whoever is doing the explaining. How can you possibly make sense of it? People on "the right" will say one thing, and people on "the left" will say another. You can believe whoever you want to believe, but if you're interested in the truth, you should just go read the manifesto.

In nearly all of these acts of horrible violence, the perpetrator themselves has left a "manifesto." Usually, these are not well written, because terrorists and mass shooters are nearly always stupid losers. But they at least attempt to tell you exactly why they did what they did. When you hear the pundits after reading the manifesto, you can see their bias much more clearly.

## "But, we shouldn't distribute a manifesto! It could be dangerous."

I've seen this argument before. Usually, most civil society media organizations will try to scrub the manifesto. They say that manifestos are dangerous, because they encourage copycats and can make the problem worse.

This argument, I think, has a great deal of merit. I don't think the manifesto should be amplified after these things. But I don't think it should be scrubbed, either. Censoring a manifesto makes it almost impossible to determine the true nature of these acts.

It is possible to believe simultaneously that terrorism and violence are evil and want to understand the underlying rationale. If you want to understand why these things are happening to us, the first step is to read the manifesto did it. They'll tell you why.
